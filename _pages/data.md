[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for [my blog](https://www.amitmerchant.com).

This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment.
