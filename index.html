<h1>Investigating Hate in Schools Through a Community Lens</h1>

<p>The ADL (2018) has reported a three-fold increase in school-based antisemitic incidences between 2015 and 2018, and a nearly two-fold increase in violent and non-violent incidences of antisemitism in general nationwide. The incidence of antisemitism in schools has mirrored the broader national trends. Among these reported incidents, high school students have used Nazi symbols, imagery, and antisemitic language to play drinking games (Singer, 2019) or invite a date to a school dance (Pink, 2019b); even in Central Indiana we have seen these symbols and gestures etched into a bathroom mirror (Lanich, 2018) and while posing for team photos (Clark, 2019). Nationally, swastikas have been found even on elementary school campuses, chalked on playgrounds (Bellafante, 2019) and painted on doors (Goldin, 2019).</p>

<p>From a curricular, training, and intervention-based perspective, it is important to understand that a school-based incident of antisemitism would need to be addressed differently in Driggs, Idaho (rural and predominantly white and Christian with few Jews in the community) than Brooklyn, New York (urban and diverse with a high Jewish population). We are drawing on the ADL H.E.A.T. Map database (ADL, 2020) of reported antisemitic incidents in schools across the nation between January 2016 and December 2019, layering these reported incidents with a variety of demographic, historical, geographic and media-related data to develop a set of “community types.” This date range was chosen because the ADL began tagging incidents as antisemitic in 2016, setting the start date, while schools began to go remote in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the end date. This community typology will be used to develop targeted interventions to prevent and/or respond to anti-Semitic incidents in communities.</p>

<p>While currently many interventions to antisemitic incidents in school and youth spaces follow a fairly standard approach (and typically involve a great deal of focus on Holocaust awareness building and education), developing meaningful a community typology will allow providers to better target specific demographic, historical, and political attributes of the communities in which these incidents occur. This work builds upon a small yet burgeoning base of using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geographic methods and perspectives in educational research to support educational policy and curricular efforts (Boschmann & Cubbon, 2014; Cobb, 2003; Lubienski & Lee, 2017; Tate IV, 2008).</p>
