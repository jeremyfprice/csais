<h1>Investigating Hate in Schools Through a Community Lens</h1>

<p>Antisemitic incidents in schools are a widespread and pervasive phenomenon. The <dfn><abbr title="Anti-Defamation League">ADL</abbr></dfn> has reported a three-fold increase in school-based antisemitic incidences between 2015 and 2018, and a nearly two-fold increase in violent and non-violent incidences of antisemitism in general nationwide.</p>

<p>This project utilizes data from the <a href="https://www.adl.org/education-and-resources/resource-knowledge-base/adl-heat-map">ADL <dfn><abbr title="Hate, Extremism, Antisemitism, Terrorism">H.E.A.T. Map</abbr></dfn></a> between 2016 and 2019 to identify incidents of antisemitism that specifically took place in schools.

<p>These incidents in schools are influenced by demographic, historical, social, and political factors. This project brings this data together to construct a community typology at the national level. This typology will provide insight into the ways that school-based incidents of hate are enacted and reported in context.</p>

<p>Developing a community typology will allow providers to better target specific demographic, historical, and political attributes of the communities in which these incidents occur.</p>
